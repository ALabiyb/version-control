        <h2>What is Version Control System (VCS)?</h2>
        <p>A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps in managing changes to code or any other set of files over time. It allows multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously, keeping track of every modification made to the codebase.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Version Control System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.</li>
            <li>History Tracking: Maintains a detailed history of changes, enabling easy rollback to previous versions.</li>
            <li>Branching and Merging: Facilitates creating separate branches for experimental features or bug fixes, which can later be merged into the main codebase.</li>
            <li>Backup and Recovery: Acts as a backup mechanism, preventing loss of work in case of accidental deletions or errors.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Popular Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>There are several version control systems available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most widely used VCS include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Git:</strong> A distributed version control system known for its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Subversion (SVN):</strong> A centralized version control system that tracks changes to files and directories over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Mercurial:</strong> Another distributed version control system designed for scalability and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Perforce (Helix Core):</strong> A commercial version control system commonly used for large-scale projects requiring high performance and enterprise-level support.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting Started with Version Control</h2>
        <p>To start using a version control system like Git, you typically need to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the version control software on your local machine.</li>
            <li>Create a new repository or clone an existing one.</li>
            <li>Add files to the repository.</li>
            <li>Commit changes to the repository with descriptive messages.</li>
            <li>Push changes to a remote repository for collaboration with others.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Version Control Systems play a crucial role in modern software development, enabling teams to collaborate efficiently, track changes accurately, and maintain code integrity throughout the development lifecycle.</p>
